In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom centre of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.


Phase 1:

The ship can move left and right within the window. Holding the key continuously keeps the ship moving. 'Q' buttons closes the window as well as x button of the window. Bullets are fired when the spacebar is pressed and deleted when it leaves the screen. 

Phase 2:

Add aliens one-by-one according to the spacing. Alien fleet moves sidewards and down until entire fleet is shot down, or alien hits the ship, or alien reaches the ground. All cases a new fleet is generated. If alien hits the ship or reaches the ground, we destroy the ship. We stop the game when the player has used up all the ships.
